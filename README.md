# Statamic Courses - Addon

## Overview

> If you want to create an online course using Statamic then this is for you!

You'll need to add *both* of these packages to your Statamic project:

- Statamic Courses Starter Kit (a free starter kit)
- Statamic Courses Addon (a paid addon)

## Features

- Courses and lessons are entries allowing you to customize the content of your course
- Unlimited courses, lessons, and students
- Track student progress
- Antler views and tags allowing for flexible course design and UX
- Configurable enrollment flow so you can have free or paid courses, memberships, etc

Note that we don't (yet?) provide these features out-of-the-box so if you want them you'll have to integrate them yourself:

- Payments, subscriptions, etc
- Quizzes
- Certificates

## Getting started

Check the documentation for installation instructions.
