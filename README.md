# Statamic Courses - Starter Kit

## Overview

> If you want to create an online course using Statamic then this is for you!

You'll need to add *both* of these packages to your Statamic project:

- Statamic Courses Starter Kit (a free starter kit)
- Statamic Courses Addon (a paid addon)

## Features

- Courses and lessons are entries allowing you to add any kind of content to your course (including video)
- Unlimited courses, lessons, and students
- Track student progress
- A theme that can be completely customized for a unique course
- Configurable enrollment flow so you can have free or paid courses, memberships, bundles, etc

And more.

Note that if you want paid courses you will have to add a payment integration yourself (a good option is [Laravel Cashier](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/billing)).

Also note that we don't (yet?) provide these features:

- Quizzes
- Certificates

## Getting started

Check the documentation for installation instructions.
